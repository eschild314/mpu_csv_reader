# Meal Plan Usage - CSV Reader

### Reads in a CSV file from the Campus Card website and displays (un)interesting statistics.

1. Create a virtual environment in the project directory, activate it, and install requirements with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Download a 12-month CSV statement from Campus Card, place it in the project directory, and rename it to `statement.csv`. *For now:* Edit it to only include the initial semester account reset to the end of the semester.
